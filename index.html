         <p>Amanda Horton is a lapsed artist who, many moons ago, went to Bournville School of Art, a mere sniff away from the famous chocolate factory (the proximity of which, did not influence her choice of college one iota).<br><br>
         <p>Whilst a student, she dabbled in many media but always came back to her trusty pencil.<br><br>Many moons (and babies) later she has at last got her hands free to pick up her pencils again and start again.<br><br>
        Pencil portraits are what she like doing best, as she tries to capture a personality from a photograph.<br><br>
        
         <p>She can produce portraits not only of people, but beloved pets too.<br><br>
         <p>Take at look at the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> to see a selection of her past work.</p> </article>
    
        
    <article class="article-two"> 
         <p>Pencil portraits make a unique and personal gift suitable fromany occasion from birthdays, to anniversarys or just as a thank you.<br><br>
         <p>A timeless reminder of a loved one can lift the spirits and is sure to give joy to the receiver.<br><br>
